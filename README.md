Machine Problems for our Computer Architecture class

MP1 - URM Tracer 

Functions: 

C - Copy value in index param1 to index param2 

J - Jump to instruction in line param3 if param1 and param2 are equal 

S - Add 1 to value in index param1 

Z - Set value in param1 equal to 0 

execute - where lines of instructions in input file are executed  

initialize - initialize the URM 

inputToArrayList - adds input in input file to the URM 

write - writes output to new file

MP2 - River Crossing Problem 

Functions: 

CrossRiver - where man and one of his possessions (R,L,C) are brought to the other end of the river /
returns true if move has been successfully carried out

checkStatus - checks status of both islands if constraints are met (i.e. Lion and Rabbit left alone in one end of the river) 

execute - contains the main loop, processes the string inputs

initialize - initialize variables every after a string input is processed 

initializeMoves - adds the sequence of moves into a queue
